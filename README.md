Code for the analyses of SAD evenness across trophic guilds

The network structure and biomass of the different trophic guilds is calculated in the script

**SAD_sugihara_abundances_model.R**

Rank-abundance diagrams from this output (Fig. 2 of the main text) are generated with

**SAD_sugihara_RAD_plot.R**

Evenness metrics (and potentiall others) is calculated with

**SAD_sugihara_model_results.R**

Lastly, metrics are plotted and analyzed with the scripts

**SAD_sugihara_metrics_plots.R**
**SAD_sugihara_metrics_regressions.R**
